  <h2 class="heading">The Challenge</h2>
  <p class="text">
    70%  of  New Years' resolutions  are abandoned  within  month  one and  only  8%  of  people actually  achieve  them. With New Years' being an important time of year for health categories, and thus Ritualâ€“ a women's vitamin, we wanted to create a campaign that was a representation of our belief in the power of healthy habit and not another false 'new year, new me' promise. 
  </p>
  <h2 class="heading">My Role</h2>
  <p class="text">
    While Creative Director at Ritual, I pitched a few concepts in the weekly marketing meeting as to how we could approach the holiday as a habit company rather than as a vitamin company. Collectively, we rallied around the concept of creating a microsite that would build a custom bot on Facebook Messenger, which both reminds and guides users on how to develop an easy-to-maintain habit. Facebook Messenger supplied us a direct line of communication to educate prospecting customers on how the small, daily task of taking a vitamin can have a big impact on health, just like their New Years Ritual.
